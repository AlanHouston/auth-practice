AUTH-PRACTICE

This is a small practice authentication server exercise using Express, JWT, MySQL, bcrypt for hashing, with React frontend.

I just wanted to work on hashing passwords and authenticating, so it does not contain much styling, and I did not secure any databases or passwords so it can be tested by others; thanks for understanding.

Node is required to run this application; install packages. In one terminal, at root level, start the server with 'node server.js' then in another terminal, cd into client, install packages, 'npm start' to display the front end in your local browser.

Now you may register your own user, then login, or login with 'frank@paddys.com' with password 'egg' to login to an already created account.

Thanks for stopping by!
